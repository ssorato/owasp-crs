[OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)](https://coreruleset.org/)

>>> The OWASP®(Open Web Application Security Project) CRS (Core Rule Set) is an open source collection of rules that work with ModSecurity® and compatible web application firewalls (WAFs). These rules are designed to provide easy to use, generic attack detection capabilities, with a minimum of false positives (false alerts), to your web application as part of a well balanced defence-in-depth solution.
